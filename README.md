# R_samples
A small collection of R code I've written for various projects at CDC

## Contents
Like the summary says, this is a very small selection of the work I've done in R for my statistical projects at CDC. Here's I've uploaded so far:

1. '''ga_pH.R''' fits generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to some TB lab data. The goal was to see whether the pH of gastric aspirate samples affects their positivity rate (i.e. yield) on MGIT culture.
2. '''mmwr.R''' runs an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis on opioid use data. The main goal here was to see whether a policy change affected opioid prescribing rates in Massachusetts (data courtesy of BCBS). The published paper is [here]('https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6541a1.htm').
